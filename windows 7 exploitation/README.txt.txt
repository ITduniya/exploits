Exploitation Documentation: Exploiting Windows 7 

Introduction:

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the exploitation process conducted on a Windows 7 ISO using various tools and techniques. The objective was to identify vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to the target system.

Tools Used:

Nmap: Network scanning tool used for initial reconnaissance and vulnerability identification.
Metasploit Framework: Exploitation framework used for launching attacks and gaining access to the target system.
Meterpreter: Post-exploitation tool used for executing commands and performing actions on the compromised system.
Screenshare: Used for sharing the desktop environment of the compromised system.

Exploitation Steps:

1. Initial Reconnaissance:
Conducted an Nmap scan to identify open ports and services on the target Windows 7 ISO.
Identified vulnerable services and potential attack vectors.

2. Vulnerability Identification:
Discovered vulnerable SMB service with the MS17-010 (EternalBlue) vulnerability.

3. Exploitation:
Selected the exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue module in Metasploit.
Configured the exploit options including the target IP address (RHOSTS) and the attacker's IP address (LHOST).
Executed the exploit, successfully compromising the target Windows 7 ISO system.

4. Post-Exploitation:
Established a Meterpreter session with the compromised system.
Executed various commands to gather system information, escalate privileges, and perform further reconnaissance.
Utilized the Screenshare functionality to view and interact with the desktop environment of the compromised system.
 

Conclusion:
The exploitation process successfully identified and exploited vulnerabilities in the target Windows 7 ISO system, demonstrating the potential risks associated with unpatched systems and the importance of robust security measures.
